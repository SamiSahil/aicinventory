    # Privacy Policy for AIC Inventory App

    **Last Updated: September 06, 2025**

    This Privacy Policy explains how the AIC Inventory App ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our application.

    ## Information We Access
    To function, our application requires permission to access, edit, create, and delete your Google Sheets spreadsheets. This permission is requested through Google's standard OAuth consent screen.

    ## How We Use Your Information
    -   **Reading Data:** The app reads data from your designated Google Sheet to display your inventory, sales, purchases, and other related information within the application dashboard.
    -   **Writing Data:** The app writes new data to your Google Sheet when you create, update, or delete records (e.g., adding a new inventory item, creating a purchase order).
    -   **Data Storage:** All of your inventory data remains exclusively within your own Google Sheet. We do not store, copy, or share your spreadsheet data on any external servers. The application acts as an interface to your data.

    ## Data Sharing
    We do not share your Google Sheets data with any third parties. Access is limited to you and anyone you have explicitly shared your Google Sheet with.

    ## Security
    We use standard Google-provided authentication libraries to ensure secure access to your account. All data transfer between the application and Google Sheets is handled over secure (HTTPS) connections.
